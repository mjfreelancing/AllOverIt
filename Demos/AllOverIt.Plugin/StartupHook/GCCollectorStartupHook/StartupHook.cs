// StartupHook Requirements:

//   - NO NAMESPACE

//   - Internal class named StartupHook

//   - Implementation inside 'public static void Initialize()'

//   - Must be built against the same or lower version of .NET Core than the app.

//   - The app that needs to load the hook(s) needs to set an environment variable
//     $env: DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS = <path to the hook DLL #1>;<path to the hook DLL #2>

// If there are any proxy DLL's (so nuget packages can be loaded, for example)
//
//   - Add a project reference to each proxy DLL

//   - Add <EnableDynamicLoading>true</EnableDynamicLoading> to the .csproj
//     so all dependencies can be loaded by the LoadContext - as recommended here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/creating-app-with-plugin-support
//
//     Note: older examples used this : <CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>
