## XX XXX 2024

### PENDING / IN-PROGRESS
* Enable nullable references
* Change properties and arguments from IReadOnlyCollection<T> to T[], where applicable
* Add 'required' to properties, where applicable - including NetStandard 2.1 support
* Consider removing extraneous null guard checks in extension methods
* Add alternative to ServiceRegistrar to provide a fluent syntax that caters for similar functionality
  plus the ability to resolve the same instance for multiple interfaces, and handle open generics.
* Update / replace how Throw<> works to save on string allocations


### Applicable to all packages
* Dopped support for NET 6 and NET 7


### AllOverIt
* EnrichedEnum previously threw ArgumentNullException when comparing to a null


### AllOverIt.Aws.Cdk.AppSync
