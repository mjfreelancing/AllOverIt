My name is [Malcolm Smith](https://twitter.com/_mjfreelancing) and live just a few hours drive North of Sydney, Australia.

I currently work as a full time C# developer using Visual Studio but also:

* have a strong background in C++
* co-authored the [C++Builder 5 Developers Guide](https://www.amazon.com.au/Builder-Developers-Guide-Book-Cdro/dp/0672319721) (2000)
* contributed, as Chief Editor, to the [C++ Builder Developers Journal](http://www.bcbjournal.org/) (2004-2015).

I am very passionate about coding to best practices using SOLID principles and strive for 100% code coverage in unit tests.

In my spare time I enjoy SCUBA diving and landscape / nature photography. You can review some of my work at [www.mjsmithphotography.com](https://www.mjsmithphotography.com/) and on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mjsmithphoto/) account.
