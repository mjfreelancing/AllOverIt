# Introduction

There's a large number of commonly used routines that get used from one application to the next. **AllOverIt** is a collection of those routines, backed by an extensive set of unit tests.

A goal of **AllOverIt** is to require nothing more than .NET Standard. There are a handful of classes that have been inspired by the work of others (with credit provided in the source) but everything is ultimately tweaked or enhanced to meet the needs of this library.

The entire library is unit tested and aims to continue meeting 100% coverage.
