        // it doesn't need to unsubscribe. That's because the subscription is manifested as the component having a reference to itself.
        // Same is true with Rx. If you're a VM and you e.g. WhenAnyValue against your own property, there's no need to clean that up because
        // that is manifested as the VM having a reference to itself.
