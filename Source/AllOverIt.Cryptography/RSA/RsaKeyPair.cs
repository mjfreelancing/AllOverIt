    /*
        Using an RSA key with a size of 3072 bits offers a level of security roughly equivalent to that of a 128-bit symmetric key.

        The determination of RSA key size being "roughly equivalent to a 128-bit symmetric key" is based on the estimation of the computational
        effort required to break each encryption scheme.The key size in symmetric encryption algorithms(e.g., AES) and asymmetric encryption
        algorithms(e.g., RSA) is measured in bits and directly impacts the strength of the encryption.

        In symmetric encryption, the security primarily relies on the secrecy of the encryption key, and the same key is used for both encryption
        and decryption.The key length directly affects the number of possible keys, and a longer key makes exhaustive search attacks more computationally
        intensive.For example, a 128-bit symmetric key has 2^128 possible combinations, making brute-force attacks infeasible with current technology.

        In asymmetric encryption (like RSA), the security is based on the mathematical relationship between the public and private keys.The key length
        here influences the size of the modulus used in RSA calculations, and it determines the number of possible keys and the difficulty of factoring
        the modulus.Longer RSA key sizes increase the difficulty of factoring, making it more secure against attacks like integer factorization.

        The approximate equivalence between RSA key size and symmetric key size is derived from the current understanding of the best known algorithms
        for factoring large numbers (used in breaking RSA) and the best known attacks against symmetric encryption algorithms.It is also based on the
        assumption that the effort required to break RSA is about the same as the effort required to perform a brute-force search on a symmetric key.
